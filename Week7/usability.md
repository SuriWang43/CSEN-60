## Notes
Common Web Usability Problems

- long text (can’t be read quickly)
- cluttered or otherwise poor layout
- requires horizontal scrolling
- assumptions about user’s screen size
- poorly chosen colors
- poor or missing navigation controls (back, forward, home)

Content Usability Problems

- most important content isn’t on the first page
- nondescript headings
- too many ads
- important site content in non-html format

Design Principles
- place name and logo on every page and make the logo a link to the homepage
    - nav bar is a great example
- provide search if the site has more than 100 pages (documentation/Wiki)

Jackob's Law of the Web User Experience
- users spend most of their time on other sites, so that's where they form their expectations for how a webpage should work
- if most big websites do something in a certain way, then follow along
    - users will expect things to work the same on your site
    - larger sites often perform extensive UI research
- test your design with real users as a reality check, people do things in odd and unexpected ways, so even the most carefully.

Most Common Site Structures
- Hierarchical
    - Deep/Shallow
    - Represented by folders in your project
- Home page is (/)
    - Everything else is under it
- Image on right is a visual sitemap
- Tips
    - 3 click rule: Generally don’t want to be more than 3 clicks away from the content you want
