    - A person with a physical disability
    - A person using a slow Internet connection
    - A person using an older computer / browser
    - A person using a mobile phone
- Accessibility helps your website’s SEO and not breaking the law

    - 2,000+ in 2019

- Vision
    Blindness, low-vision, color blindness
- Hearing

Assistive Technologies
Screen Readers
- change the visual display into audio output
    - scan a window and read things in the order they appear
    - Some take HTML structure into account
    - Useful for those with vision or literacy difficulties
- Braille displays
    - Provide output as Braille rather than audio
    - Useful if both blind and deaf
- Effects of these
    - Web page is reduced entirely to text
    - Browsing is a time-based experience
        - Navigation bar at top will be read for every page

Screen Magnifiers
- Simple solutions
    - Increasing the font size in the browser
    - Zoom the browser
- Large scale magnification (400+%)
    - Might cause loss of Context
    - Might make the page difficult to use
        - Especially if there is a lot of blank space
- Apple Hover Text


Screen Reader Mode
- Simple alternatives
    - sticky keys, slow keys
- Uses
    - Some users cannot use the mouse
    - Some can’t use keyboard, but use an onscreen keyboard
    - Keyboards are difficult to use on phone/tablet
- Navigate with only the keyboard
    - Keyboard as the mouse
    - Other devices simulate keyboard input
    - Tab sequences should be logical and valid

W3C Web Accessibility Initiative
- perceivable
    - provide text-alternatives for non-text content

    - Do not use content that can cause seizures
    - Help user navigate and find content
- Understandable
    - Make text readable and understandable
    - Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
    - Help users avoid and correct mistakes
- Robust
    - Maximize compatibility with current assistive tools
    - Maximize compatibility with future assistive tools

Color Contrast
- https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
- Goal is at least 5:1
- AA rating is 5:1
